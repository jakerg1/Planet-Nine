# Planet X Candidate Search – SDSS Data

This project uses real observational data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** to search for potential candidates for the hypothetical **Planet Nine** (also known as Planet X).

### 🔍 Overview:
Planet Nine is a proposed planet in the outer solar system that could explain anomalies in the orbits of distant trans-Neptunian objects. While it's never been directly observed, surveys like SDSS contain vast catalogs that can be filtered to identify potential candidates based on location, brightness, and other criteria.

### 🧠 What This Project Does:
- Loads and explores SDSS photometric data
- Applies filters to isolate moving objects with high proper motion
- Analyzes object brightness and sky position to find Planet Nine candidates
- Visualizes selected data to guide follow-up study

### 💡 Skills Demonstrated:
- Astronomy-focused data cleaning and filtering
- Use of pandas, matplotlib, and numpy for real-world data analysis
- Hypothesis testing using observational constraints
- Efficient use of Python in a research-style workflow
